# Laravel Project

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of web development by easing common tasks used in many web projects.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1
- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP Extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   ```

2. Move to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Create a copy of your .env file
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Generate an app encryption key
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. Create an empty database for your application

7. In the .env file, add database information to allow Laravel to connect to the database

8. Migrate the database
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

9. [Optional] Seed the database
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

## Running the Application

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`

## Testing

```bash
php artisan test
```
